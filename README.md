# Solutions to Leetcode Problems

These are a set of solutions to several programming problems on Leetcode.

The directory `solutions` is intended to house the solution descriptions while the directory `code` is for implementations in C++, Python, and Java. At this time, most of the solutions are included in the code in the form of code comments.

Solutions and code are named using the url slug of the problem on Leetcode. For e.g., if the problem url is `https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/`,
  * the solution, if one exists, is in `solutions/maximum-subarray.md`
  * the C++ code, if it exists, is in `code/cpp/maximum-subarray.cc`
  * the Python code, if it exists, in `code/cpp/maximum-subarray.py` and so on.
  
For several problems, different implementations are named using a suffix starting with an `_` (e.g., `_brute`, `_memoized`, `_opt`, etc.).
