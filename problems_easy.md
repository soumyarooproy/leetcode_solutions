### Rotate Array (#189)
* Simple approach - reverse the entire array and then reverse the two ranges - `[0, k)` and `[k, n)` separately
* Other approaches - EPI's approach and `std::rotate()` approach
### Factorial Trailing Zeroes (#172)
* Zeroes are contributed only by 10's, whose prime factors are `2` and `5`
* In the first `n` numbers, `2` is contributed by `2, 4, 6, 8, ...` while `5` is contributed by `5, 10, 15, 20, ...`
* It suffices to count the number of `5`'s because there will be at least as many `2`'s available to pair with the `5`'s
   * Remember to account for the fact that `25 = 5 * 5`, `625 = 5 * 25`, etc.

### Excel Sheet Column Title (#168)
### Two Sum II - Input array is sorted (#167)
* Use two indices - one that starts at the leftmost index and moves rightwards and the other that starts are the rightmost index and moves leftwards
* if `val[leftindex] + val[rightindex] == target`, return `True`
   * Otherwise, if `val[leftindex] + val[rightindex] > target`, increment `leftindex`
   * Otherwise, decrement `rightindex`
### Intersection of Two Linked Lists (#160)
### Read N Characters Given Read4 (#157)
* If the stream has at least `N` characters, use `Read4()` `floor(N/4)` times to read all characters except the final `1-3` characters
   * For the last `1-3` characters, read `4` characters but serve back exactly as many characters as needed
* Otherwise, return as many characters as there are in the stream
### Min Stack (#155)
* Use a tuple of `(key, min_key)` to store in the stack, i.e., propagate the `min_key` up the stack
### Linked List Cycle (#141)
* Use fast and slow pointers

* Since this needs to be done in place, start writing in the final array from the back
* Use two **_read_** indices to keep a track of the **_next largest_** key in each of the two sorted arrays
* Use a **_write_** index to track the position the **_next larger_** key in the final array
